TICKETS TO CLASSIFY:
{tickets}

CLASSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. TOPIC TAGS (Choose the most relevant primary tag for each ticket):
   - How-to: Questions about using features, setup instructions, or basic guidance
   - Product: General product functionality, feature requests, or product-related inquiries
   - Connector: Issues with data connectors, connection setup, or integration problems
   - Lineage: Questions about data lineage, tracking, or visualization
   - API/SDK: Developer-related questions, API usage, SDK implementation
   - SSO: Single Sign-On authentication, login issues, or identity management
   - Glossary: Data dictionary, metadata management, or glossary-related queries
   - Best practices: Guidance on optimal usage, recommendations, or strategic advice
   - Sensitive data: Data privacy, security, compliance, or sensitive data handling

2. SENTIMENT (Assess the customer's emotional tone):
   - Frustrated: Customer shows clear signs of frustration, repeated issues, or escalation
   - Curious: Genuine questions, learning-oriented, exploratory tone
   - Angry: Strong negative emotions, complaints, or dissatisfaction
   - Neutral: Professional, matter-of-fact tone without strong emotions
   - Urgent: Time-sensitive requests with business impact mentioned
   - Confused: Uncertainty, unclear requirements, or need for clarification

3. PRIORITY (Based on business impact and urgency):
   - P0 (High): Critical issues blocking business operations, production problems, security concerns, or major integrations with tight deadlines
   - P1 (Medium): Important issues affecting workflow, setup problems, or functionality questions with moderate business impact
   - P2 (Low): General questions, feature requests, best practice inquiries, or non-blocking issues

CLASSIFICATION LOGIC:

For TOPIC classification:
- If the ticket mentions specific connectors (Snowflake, Fivetran, dbt, Tableau, etc.) or connection issues → "Connector"
- If asking about data flow, tracking, or relationships between datasets → "Lineage"
- If mentioning APIs, SDKs, development, or technical integration → "API/SDK"
- If about authentication, login, or access control → "SSO"
- If asking how to perform specific tasks or seeking guidance → "How-to"
- If about metadata, data dictionary, or definitions → "Glossary"
- If requesting recommendations or strategic advice → "Best practices"
- If about data privacy, security, or compliance → "Sensitive data"
- If general product functionality or feature-related → "Product"

For SENTIMENT classification:
- Look for emotional indicators: "urgent", "blocked", "critical", "frustrated", "not working"
- Consider business impact mentions: "team is blocked", "major project", "leadership presentation"
- Assess tone: professional vs emotional, questioning vs demanding

For PRIORITY classification:
- P0: Production issues, team blockers, security concerns, tight deadlines mentioned
- P1: Setup issues, functionality problems, moderate business impact
- P2: General inquiries, learning questions, non-urgent requests
