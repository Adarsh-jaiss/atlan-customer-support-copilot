Documentation conventions[¬∂](#documentation-conventions "Permanent link")
=========================================================================

We use icons to quickly convey contextual details about features illustrated in code. Following is the complete list of such icons and their meaning:

### [x.y.z](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli/releases/tag/vx.y.z "Minimum version") Atlan CLI version[¬∂](#xyz-atlan-cli-version "Permanent link")

The terminal symbol in conjunction with a version number denotes when a specific feature or behavior was added to the Atlan CLI. Make sure you're at least on this version if you want to use it the way it is illustrated in any code blocks.

### [x.y.z](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-java/releases/tag/vx.y.z "Minimum version") Java SDK version[¬∂](#xyz-java-sdk-version "Permanent link")

The Java symbol in conjunction with a version number denotes when a specific feature or behavior was added to the Java SDK. Make sure you're at least on this version if you want to use it the way it is illustrated in any code blocks.

Also applies to Kotlin

Since the Java SDK is also used for Kotlin, the same minimum version requirement applies to any Kotlin functionality and code blocks as well.

### [x.y.z](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-python/releases/tag/x.y.z "Minimum version") Python SDK version[¬∂](#xyz-python-sdk-version "Permanent link")

The Python symbol in conjunction with a version number denotes when a specific feature or behavior was added to the Python SDK. Make sure you're at least on this version if you want to use it the way it is illustrated in any code blocks.

### [x.y.z](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-go/releases/tag/x.y.z "Minimum version") Go SDK version[¬∂](#xyz-go-sdk-version "Permanent link")

The Go symbol in conjunction with a version number denotes when a specific feature or behavior was added to the Go SDK. Make sure you're at least on this version if you want to use it the way it is illustrated in any code blocks.

### Experimental features[¬∂](#experimental-features "Permanent link")

Some newer features are still considered experimental. These will be clearly marked as such here in [developer.atlan.com](https://developer.atlan.com), as well as in the release notes for the SDK version where they are introduced.

Subject to change

Please note that experimental features are subject to change prior to their final form. Such changes will not cause a change to the major version of the SDK.

Conversely, for any feature not marked experimental, we aim ensure no breaking changes are made to it without incrementing the major version of the SDK.
