Events when an asset is tagged[¶](#events-when-an-asset-is-tagged "Permanent link")
===================================================================================

When an [asset](../../../getting-started/#what-is-an-asset) is tagged in Atlan, the following event is emitted.

`CLASSIFICATION_ADD`[¶](#classification_add "Permanent link")
-------------------------------------------------------------

Atlan always emits a [`CLASSIFICATION_ADD`](../../types/classification_add/) event when an asset is tagged.

For both direct tags and propagations

Remember that these events will be emitted for both the asset that was directly tagged as well as all assets to which the tag is propagated.
