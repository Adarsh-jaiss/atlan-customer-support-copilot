Governance structures[¶](#governance-structures "Permanent link")
=================================================================

As developers ourselves, we know that learning is often easiest through example.

In this **Governance structures** operations section you will find details about managing the structures that can be used to govern your assets, rather than managing the assets themselves.

You may also want to explore:

* ---

    Common operations on assets, that are available across all assets.

     [Discover actions](../snippets/)
* ---

    Operations that are specific to certain assets.

     [Focus on a specific kind of asset](../patterns/)
