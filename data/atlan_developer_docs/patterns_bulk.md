Bulk updates[¶](#bulk-updates "Permanent link")
===============================================

For most of the write operations covered in the above sections, you can also:

* [Combine multiple operations together](../../snippets/advanced-examples/combine/)
* [Make changes to multiple assets at the same time](multiple-assets/)

Optimize changes

These each allow you to optimize your work. Rather than making a separate API call for each change or each asset, you can make a single API call that includes all your changes — even across many assets.

Of course, in order to change multiple assets you also need to first know which assets to change.

To do this, there is a [common end\-to\-end bulk update pattern](end-to-end/) you can follow.
