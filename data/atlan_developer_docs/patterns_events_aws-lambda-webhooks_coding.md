Coding your logic[Â¶](#coding-your-logic "Permanent link")
=========================================================

What events you want to process and how you want to process them is up to you.

We have tried to make writing this logic as simple as possible via the SDKs:

Java

Python

In Java, create a new class that implements the following from the  [Java SDK](../../../../sdks/):

* Extend the `com.atlan.events.AbstractLambdaHandler` class.
* Implement the `com.atlan.events.AtlanEventHandler` interface.

The `AbstractLambdaHandler` class handles receiving and parsing the event through the AWS Lambda function, and passing it along to your logic for processing. The `AtlanEventHandler` interface defines 5 methods that are executed in logical sequence to carry out your event\-handling:

1. `validatePrerequisites()` validates the event contains information you expect and intend to process.
2. `getCurrentState()` retrieves the current state of the asset in the event from Atlan. This limits the possibility you are working against stale data.
3. `calculateChanges()` is where you will implement the majority of your logic. This is where you look up any additional information, make any changes to assets, create notifications in external systems, and so on.

    Ensure idempotency

    You should only return assets from this method that have actually changed, to ensure idempotency. If you blindly return every asset of interest every time from this method, you may end up with an infinite loop of picking up an event, sending back a change to Atlan, which generates another event, this handler sends back another change, and so on ad infinitum.

    The `hasChanges()` method below can be helpful to think through how to detect what has actually changed and thus needs to be sent back to Atlan.
4. `hasChanges()` is a convenience method you can implement to determine whether an asset has changed or not. You would typically call it from within your `calculateChanges()` implementation above.
5. `upsertChanges()` takes any of the changed assets from the `calculateChanges()` method and actually sends these back to Atlan for persistence. (Each such change may then generate subsequent events that either this or other handlers can then pickup.)

| Example: reverting verified assets that have no description or owner | |

1. You can package your event handler with whatever name you want.
2. Ensure that it extends the `com.atlan.events.AbstractLambdaHandler` class.
3. Ensure that it also implements the `com.atlan.events.AtlanEventHandler` class.
4. Of course you can set up any of your own variables. In this example, since we want to validate certain information is present on the asset, we're defining a list of those attributes we want to check on the asset.
5. Most methods in `AtlanEventHandler` provide a default implementation that you may be able to reuse (like `validatePrerequisites()` in this example), but you can always override the default implementation as well.
6. `AtlanEventHandler` also provides a number of static methods for common actions, such as an efficient way of retrieving the current view of an asset with a minimal set of information.
7. By breaking down the logic into these 5 different methods, you can more precisely think through the logic of how to handle your events. In this example, we only need to consider changing an asset if:

    * It is currently verified, and
        * it is missing either a description or an owner
8. During event\-handling you may want to change several assets. For example, you may want to look at lineage and change multiple upstream or downstream assets. Hence the method allows returning any collection of assets.

    The functionality in this example only needs to potentially modify the single asset in the event: specifically changing its certificate back to `DRAFT` and leaving an enforcement message, if it should not have been verified in the first place.
9. For efficiency, you may want to create a singleton for this class for reuse in the next step.
10. All you need to then do to "register" this class to handle events through the Lambda function is define a default constructor that sends your class up to the `AbstractLambdaHandler` superclass. The superclass will then take care of everything else.

In Python, create a module (file) that extends the following from the  [Python SDK](../../../../sdks/):

* Defines a new class, that extends the `pyatlan.events.atlan_event_handler.AtlanEventHandler` class.
* Defines a new function `lambda_handler(event, context)` that calls the `pyatlan.events.atlan_lambda_handler.process_event` function.

The `lambda_handler` function is necessary to receive the event from the AWS Lambda function, but then only needs to pass it off to the `process_event` function for parsing and processing using your logic. The `AtlanEventHandler` superclass defines 5 methods that are executed in logical sequence (by `process_event`) to carry out your event\-handling:

1. `validate_prerequisites()` validates the event contains information you expect and intend to process.
2. `get_current_state()` retrieves the current state of the asset in the event from Atlan. This limits the possibility you are working against stale data.
3. `calculate_changes()` is where you will implement the majority of your logic. This is where you look up any additional information, make any changes to assets, create notifications in external systems, and so on.

    Ensure idempotency

    You should only return assets from this method that have actually changed, to ensure idempotency. If you blindly return every asset of interest every time from this method, you may end up with an infinite loop of picking up an event, sending back a change to Atlan, which generates another event, this handler sends back another change, and so on ad infinitum.

    The `has_changes()` method below can be helpful to think through how to detect what has actually changed and thus needs to be sent back to Atlan.
4. `has_changes()` is a convenience method you can implement to determine whether an asset has changed or not. You would typically call it from within your `calculate_changes()` implementation above.
5. `upsert_changes()` takes any of the changed assets from the `calculate_changes()` method and actually sends these back to Atlan for persistence. (Each such change may then generate subsequent events that either this or other handlers can then pickup.)

1. You can of course set up any of your own variables. In this example, since we want to validate certain information is present on the asset, we're defining a list of those attributes we want to check on the asset.
2. You will need to initialize an AtlanClient, to interact with Atlan. (This will auto\-configure based on those environment variables you set up earlier.)
3. You can package your event handler with whatever name you want. Just ensure it extends the `pyatlan.events.atlan_event_handler.AtlanEventHandler` class.
4. Most methods in `AtlanEventHandler` provide a default implementation that you may be able to reuse (like `validate_prerequisites()` in this example), but you can always override the default implementation as well.
5. `AtlanEventHandler` also provides a number of utility methods for common actions, such as an efficient way of retrieving the current view of an asset with a minimal set of information.

8. All you need to then do to "register" this class to handle events through the Lambda function is define a `lambda_handler(event, context)` function that sends your class and client to the `process_event` function \- it will then take care of everything else.
