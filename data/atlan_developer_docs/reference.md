Full reference material[¶](#full-reference-material "Permanent link")
=====================================================================

Under this top\-level menu you will find full reference materials. These are intended to cover full, in\-depth explanations of everything you can use in different areas of Atlan.

* [Searching](../search/) — detailing all the different mechanisms you can use to search for metadata in Atlan.
* [Events](../events/) — detailing every type of event that Atlan produces and the triggers that produce them.
* [Endpoints](../endpoints/) — listing every endpoint available in Atlan cross\-referenced with the use cases each endpoint enables.

Due to its size, the full reference material for types (models) is under the separate top\-level [Types](../models/) menu.
