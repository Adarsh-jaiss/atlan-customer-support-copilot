Atlan CLI[¬∂](#atlan-cli "Permanent link")
=========================================

Limited functionality (so far)

You can use Atlan's command\-line interface (CLI) to manage some metadata in Atlan. Currently data contracts and metadata for a limited set of asset types can be managed through the CLI.

Obtain the CLI[¬∂](#obtain-the-cli "Permanent link")
---------------------------------------------------

[0\.1\.0](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli/releases/tag/v0.1.0 "Minimum version")

For now, the CLI must be downloaded as a pre\-built binary:

Recommended

When installed via Homebrew, you can easily keep things up\-to\-date. If you do not use it already, see Homebrew's own installation documents for [setting up Homebrew itself](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) .

```
brew tap atlanhq/atlan
brew install atlan

```

```
curl -o atlan.tgz -L https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli-releases/releases/latest/download/atlan_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
tar xf atlan.tgz

```

```
curl -o atlan.tgz -L https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli-releases/releases/latest/download/atlan_Darwin_amd64.tar.gz
tar xf atlan.tgz

```

```
curl -o atlan.tgz -L https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli-releases/releases/latest/download/atlan_Linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxf atlan.tgz

```

```
curl -o atlan.zip -L https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli-releases/releases/latest/download/atlan_Windows_amd64.zip
unzip atlan.zip

```

Configure the CLI[¬∂](#configure-the-cli "Permanent link")
---------------------------------------------------------

[0\.1\.0](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli/releases/tag/v0.1.0 "Minimum version")

You can configure the CLI using a config file or in some cases environment variables, with the following minimum settings[1](#fn:1):

| .atlan/config.yaml | |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` atlan_api_key: eyZid92...  # (1) atlan_base_url: https://tenant.atlan.com  # (2) log:   enabled: false  # (3)   level: info  # (4)  ``` |

1. An API token that has access to your assets.
2. The base URL of your tenant (including the `https://`).
3. (Optional) Enable logging to produce more details on what the CLI is doing.
4. When logging is enabled, specify the level of verbosity.

| Environment variables | |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` ATLAN_API_KEY=eyZid92...  # (1)  ``` |

1. An API token that has access to your assets.

### Define data sources[¬∂](#define-data-sources "Permanent link")

You should also define data sources in the config file:

| .atlan/config.yaml | |
| --- | --- |
| ```  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ``` | ``` data_source snowflake:  # (1)   type: snowflake  # (2)   connection:  # (3)     name: snowflake-prod  # (4)     qualified_name: "default/snowflake/1234567890"  # (5)   database: db  # (6)   schema: analytics  # (7)  ``` |

1. Each data source definition must start with `data_source`, followed by a space and a unique reference name for the data source (`snowflake` in this example).

    Reference name is your choice

    The reference name you give in the configuration file is only used here and as a reference in any data contracts you define. It need not match the name of the connection or data source in Atlan itself.
2. You must indicate the type of connector for the data source (see [connector types](../../models/connectortypes/) for options).
3. Details of the connection must also be provided.
4. You must provide the `name` of the connection, as it appears in Atlan.
5. You must provide the unique `qualified_name` of the connection in Atlan.
6. (Optional) You can also specify the database to use for this connection's assets by default, if none is specified in the data contract.
7. (Optional) You can also specify the schema to use for this connection's assets by default, if none is specified in the data contract.

These ensure the CLI can map the details you specify in your data contract to the appropriate corresponding asset in Atlan.

What's next?[¬∂](#whats-next "Permanent link")
---------------------------------------------

With the CLI, you can:

* [Manage data contracts](../../snippets/datacontract/)
* [Upload and download files](../../snippets/files/) from Atlan's backing object store
* [Sync metadata](../../snippets/datacontract/manage/#sync-metadata) to a limited set of asset types
* [Integrate data contracts with CI/CD](../../snippets/datacontract/manage/#managing-via-cicd) processing

---

1. When both are specified, environment variables will take precedence.[‚Ü©](#fnref:1 "Jump back to footnote 1 in the text")
