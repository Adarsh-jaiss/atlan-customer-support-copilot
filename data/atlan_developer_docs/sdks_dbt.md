Atlan University

See it in action in our [automated enrichment course](https://university.atlan.com/training/e12c0834-0ad9-11ee-8e89-06e5f0a66511/overview) (45 mins).

You can use [dbt's `meta` field](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta)  to enrich metadata resources from dbt into Atlan. Atlan will ingest the information from this field and update the [assets](../../getting-started/#what-is-an-asset) in Atlan accordingly.

With this, you have a powerful way to keep the dbt assets documented directly as part of your dbt work.

The following is an example:

| dbt example | |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 ``` | ``` version: 2 models:   - name: customers     description: >- # (1)       This table has basic information about a customer, as well as some derived       facts based on a customer's orders.     meta: # (2)       atlan: # (3)         attributes: # (4)           certificateStatus: DRAFT           ownerUsers: ["bryan", "ashwin"]         classifications: # (5)           - typeName: "ipubxAPPb0zRcNU1Gkjs9b"             propagate: true             removePropagationsOnEntityDelete: true             restrictPropagationThroughLineage: true             restrictPropagationThroughHierarchy: false      columns:       - name: customer_id         description: This is a unique identifier for a customer         tests:           - unique           - not_null       - name: total_order_amount         description: Total value (AUD) of a customer's orders.       - name: customer_lifetime_value         meta: # (6)           atlan:             attributes:               description: Customer lifetime value.               certificateStatus: DRAFT               ownerUsers: ["ravi"]             classifications:               - typeName: "ipubxAPPb0zRcNU1Gkjs9b"                 propagate: true                 removePropagationsOnEntityDelete: true  ``` |

1. The `description` at the top level of an asset defined in dbt will already be mapped to the description field for that asset in Atlan.
2. More detailed metadata, however, needs to be specified within the `meta` field.
3. ... and within the `meta` field, further within the `atlan` sub\-field.
4. For attributes, such as certificates, announcements, or owners these need to be specified within the `attributes` sub\-field.
5. Classifications need to be specified within a `classifications` sub\-field.
6. Note that the `meta` field and its sub\-structure (including all the detailed attributes) can also be applied to columns within a model.

This rich metadata will then be loaded to the corresponding attributes on the asset in Atlan.

For more details on specific examples, see the **dbt** tabs in the [Common asset actions](../../snippets/common-examples/) snippets.
