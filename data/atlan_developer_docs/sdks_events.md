Events[¶](#events "Permanent link")
===================================

Atlan produces events when certain activities occur in the system. You can tap into these in a push\-based integration model to take action the moment they occur.

To tap into the events, you need to first set up a [webhook](https://ask.atlan.com/hc/en-us/articles/7145739770511)  in Atlan.

Have a look at the [event handling pattern](../../patterns/events/) for more details on implementing event\-handling from webhooks using either of the SDKs.
