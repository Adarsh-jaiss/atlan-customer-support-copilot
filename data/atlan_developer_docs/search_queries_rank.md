Rank feature queries[¶](#rank-feature-queries "Permanent link")
===============================================================

Rank feature queries allow you to boost the relevance of results based on the value of a numeric field.[1](#fn:1)

Unlike other queries, you don't search on a rank query field itself but instead use it to change the relevance score of results to boost them higher up.

Coming soon
