Full text queries[¬∂](#full-text-queries "Permanent link")
=========================================================

Full text queries allow you to find results based on analyzed text fields.[1](#fn:1) For example, by a word or phrase within a longer description.

Unlike [term\-level queries](../terms/), the search terms you use in a full\-text query *are* analyzed. This means what you search for is tokenized first (broken up into separate words), singular / plural variants determined, synonyms applied, and so on.

**Details**

Below are the various kinds of full text queries. These are sorted with the most commonly used at the top, and cover their usual usage. Each one is linked to Elasticsearch's own documentation to provide greater details. (In most cases there are many more options for each kind of query than what is documented here.)

Match[¬∂](#match "Permanent link")
---------------------------------

[1\.0\.0](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-python/releases/tag/1.0.0 "Minimum version")[4\.0\.0](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-java/releases/tag/v4.0.0 "Minimum version")

[Match queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query.html)  return results where the asset's value for that attribute matches some part of what you're searching.

Java

Python

Kotlin

Raw REST API

| Build the query and request | |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` IndexSearchRequest index = client.assets.select() // (1)     .where(Asset.NAME.match("tmp")) // (1)     .toRequest();  ``` |

1. You can search across all assets using the `select()` method of the `assets` member on any client.
2. Chain a `where()` onto the select, with the static constant representing a field of the type you want to search to start a query, in this case the `NAME` of an `Asset`. Adding the `match()` predicate creates a match query.

    Equivalent query through Elastic
    ```
    Query byMatch =  MatchQuery.of(m -> m
        .field("name")
        .query("tmp")
      ._toQuery();

    ```

| Build the query | |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` from pyatlan.model.assets import Asset from pyatlan.model.fluent_search import FluentSearch  index = (FluentSearch()  # (1)          .where(Asset.NAME.match("tmp"))  # (2)         ).to_request()  ``` |

1. You can search across all assets using a `FluentSearch()` object.
2. Use the class variable representing a field of the type you want to search to start a query, in this case the `NAME` of an `Asset`. Adding the `match()` predicate creates a match query.

| Build the query and request | |
| --- | --- |

    val byMatch =  MatchQuery.of(m -> m
        .field("name")
        .query("tmp")
      ._toQuery()

    ```

| POST /api/meta/search/indexsearch | |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 ``` | ``` {   "dsl": { // (1)     "query": { // (2)       "match": { // (3)         "name": { // (4)           "query": "tmp" // (5)         }       }     }   } }  ``` |

1. Queries must be within the `dsl` object in the API...
2. ...and within that the `query` object.
3. For a match query, there needs to be a `match` object embedded within the `query` object.
4. Within this object should be a key with the name of the Elasticsearch field (Atlan attribute) to match against.
5. The value for this field (attribute) to match against should be given through the `query` property.

Match phrase[¬∂](#match-phrase "Permanent link")
-----------------------------------------------

[5\.0\.1](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-python/releases/tag/5.0.1 "Minimum version")

Unlike a regular [`match`](./#match) query, which performs a full\-text search and may return results with individual words appearing in any order, a `match_phrase` query ensures that the terms appear in the exact order specified.

For example, to search for assets where the `description` field contains the exact phrase `"data pipeline"`:

Java

Python

Kotlin

1. You can search across all assets using a `FluentSearch()` object.
2. Use the class variable representing a field of the type you want to search to start a query, in this case the `DESCRIPTION` of an `Asset`. Adding the `match_phrase()` predicate creates a match phrase query.
