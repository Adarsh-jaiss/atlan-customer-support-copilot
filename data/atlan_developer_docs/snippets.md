Common tasks[¬∂](#common-tasks "Permanent link")
===============================================

As developers ourselves, we know that learning is often easiest through example.

In this **Common tasks** section you will find examples and explanations of the most common tasks in Atlan ‚Äî those that are available on all assets.

However, if you want to find out how to do something unique to a particular kind of asset, or to do something orthogonal to assets, you may also want to explore:

* ---

    Operations that are specific to certain assets.

     [Focus on a specific kind of asset](../patterns/)
* ---

    Operations dealing with governance structures, rather than assets.

     [Manage governance structures](../governance/)
