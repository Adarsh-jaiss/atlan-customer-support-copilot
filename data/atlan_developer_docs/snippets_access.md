Access control and personalization[¬∂](#access-control-and-personalization "Permanent link")
===========================================================================================

Atlan provides a [number of ways to manage access control](https://ask.atlan.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413877880209) , at both coarse\-grained and granular levels.

The primary vehicles for granular access control are [personas](https://ask.atlan.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413870860049) , [purposes](https://ask.atlan.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418690792849) , and the access policies defined within these.

Both personas and purposes can also be used to personalize the experience, by controlling:

* which assets are visible to a particular audience
* which details of each of those assets are visible
