Asset CRUD operations[¶](#asset-crud-operations "Permanent link")
=================================================================

In this section you'll find details about creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and searching for [assets](../../getting-started/#what-is-an-asset). Rather than covering every asset type in detail (since there are many), the subsections focus on the operations and patterns to follow for each operation.

For more details on specific assets that are primarily intended to be managed programmatically, see the [API\-first models](../../patterns/create/).

* [Create an asset](create/)
* [Retrieve an asset](read/)
* [Update an asset](update/)
* [Delete an asset](delete/)
* [Restore an asset](restore/)
* [View history of an asset](history/)
* [Search for assets](search/)

In many cases, you can also [combine multiple operations](combine/) into a single API call for efficiency.
