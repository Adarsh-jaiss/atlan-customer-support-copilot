Glossary introduction[¬∂](#glossary-introduction "Permanent link")
=================================================================

Operations on glossary assets (glossaries, categories, terms).

Glossaries are a container for both terms and categories

Terms and categories can only exist within a glossary. So a glossary must first exist, before you can create a term or category. This also means that if you delete a glossary, all of the terms and categories within that glossary are also deleted.

Note as well that terms are *not* contained within categories. Categories are simply a mechanism to organize terms in Atlan. This means that deleting a category will *not* delete the terms related to it.

```
erDiagram
    Glossary ||--o{ GlossaryCategory : contains
    Glossary ||--o{ GlossaryTerm : contains
```
Each glossary object *mostly* behaves like other assets in Atlan. You can [create](create/), [retrieve](retrieve-by-name/), [update](../../advanced-examples/update/), [delete](../../advanced-examples/delete/), [restore](../../advanced-examples/restore/), [view history](../../advanced-examples/history/), [search](../../advanced-examples/search/), and [combine operations](../../advanced-examples/combine/) using the same patterns as for any other asset.

Unique characteristics of glossary objects

There are, however, a few points that are unique to glossary objects compared to other asset types:

* The [qualifiedNames](../../../getting-started/#qualifiedname_1) of all glossary objects are a hashed string. This is not human\-readable. All other asset types have qualifiedNames that are human\-readable. We have provided [helper methods](retrieve-by-name/) specifically for retrieval of glossary assets by their human\-readable names.
* When [updating](../../advanced-examples/update/) a contained glossary object (term or category), you must provide details about the parent glossary of that object. You can update all other asset types without re\-specifying their parent object.

As a result, the `creator()` and `updater()` builder methods for terms and categories require extra parameters to specify the glossary.

The other difference that exists in interacting with glossaries is the common need to [traverse](hierarchy/) their hierarchy of categories.
