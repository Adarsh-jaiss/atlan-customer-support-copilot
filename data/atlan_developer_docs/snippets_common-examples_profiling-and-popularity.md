Profiling and popularity[¬∂](#profiling-and-popularity "Permanent link")
=======================================================================

Atlan crawls additional context from some sources, to give you information on the values that exist within the data and how the data is used.

Profiling[¬∂](#profiling "Permanent link")
-----------------------------------------

Profiling gives additional context to columns in relational stores. From profiling, you can see various summarized information such as:

* numerical statistics (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, sum, variance) for numeric columns
* minimum, maximum, and average lengths for string columns
* distinct value counts and percentages
* missing value counts and percentages

Profiling is *only* available on columns

You will only be able to populate this summary information on columns, not on other assets in Atlan.

Popularity[¬∂](#popularity "Permanent link")
-------------------------------------------

Popularity gives additional context on how assets are being used. From popularity, you can see information such as:

* which users are querying assets
* the costs associated with those queries
* how long the queries run
* the queries themselves

This information can be populated on all assets in Atlan.
