Toolkits [¬∂](#toolkits "Permanent link")
========================================

Writing code is great, but there additional frameworks you can use to tap more directly into Atlan.

In this **Toolkits** section you will find details about these frameworks.

Internal use only

For now, these toolkits are only available for Atlanians 

How they work[¬∂](#how-they-work "Permanent link")
-------------------------------------------------

Our toolkits are mostly built on [Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/index.html) , a configuration language developed by Apple.

This allows you to develop your idea:

* Safely, based on a guard\-railed set of options
* Independently from any specific programming language
* Offline from a running Atlan tenant

We can then automatically translate that into the necessary bindings for Atlan's:

* UI widgets
* Data model
* Orchestration plane

Get started[¬∂](#get-started "Permanent link")
---------------------------------------------

To get started, you'll need to install `pkl` and configure its plugin in your favorite IDE.

### Install `pkl`[¬∂](#install-pkl "Permanent link")

Start by [installing the `pkl` CLI](https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/pkl-cli/index.html#installation) :

MacOS

Linux (aarch64\)

Linux (amd64\)

Alpine (amd64\)

Windows

```
brew install pkl

```

```
curl -L -o pkl https://github.com/apple/pkl/releases/download/0.28.1/pkl-linux-aarch64
chmod +x pkl

```

```
curl -L -o pkl https://github.com/apple/pkl/releases/download/0.28.1/pkl-linux-amd64
chmod +x pkl

```

```
curl -L -o pkl https://github.com/apple/pkl/releases/download/0.28.1/pkl-alpine-linux-amd64
chmod +x pkl

```

```
curl -L -o jpkl https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/pkl-lang/pkl-cli-java/0.28.1/jpkl
chmod +x jpkl

```
Note the CLI command is `jpkl`

On Windows (or any other platform using the Java executable), the command is `jpkl` rather than `pkl`.

### Configure in an IDE[¬∂](#configure-in-an-ide "Permanent link")

Then configure `pkl` in your favorite IDE:

JetBrains

VS Code

Neovim

For now you'll have to rely on [Pkl's own instructions](https://pkl-lang.org/vscode/current/index.html) .
