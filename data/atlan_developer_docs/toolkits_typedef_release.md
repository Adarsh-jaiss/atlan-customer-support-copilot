GA the model[¬∂](#ga-the-model "Permanent link")
-----------------------------------------------

Only do this after first testing the model and its UX

Be sure to first [test your model](../test-model/) and [test the baseline UX](../test-ux/) before requesting your typedef become generally available, to validate that you have everything as you want it. Making changes to typedefs after\-the\-fact can be problematic or impossible in many cases.

Once you are happy with your typedef model and want to make it generally available for all:

1. Raise a pull request (PR) from your branch (`JIRA-TASK-ID`) to `beta` on [atlanhq/models](https://github.com/atlanhq/models) .
2. Request someone review the PR by posting a simple message with a link to the PR on [\#collab\-models](https://atlanhq.slack.com/archives/C067ECN8GFQ) .

Once approved and merged to `beta`, you'll need to do the same to both `staging` and `master`:

1. Raise a pull request (PR) from your branch (`JIRA-TASK-ID`) to `staging` on [atlanhq/models](https://github.com/atlanhq/models) .
2. Request someone review the PR by posting a simple message with a link to the PR on [\#collab\-models](https://atlanhq.slack.com/archives/C067ECN8GFQ) .
3. Raise a pull request (PR) from your branch (`JIRA-TASK-ID`) to `master` on [atlanhq/models](https://github.com/atlanhq/models) .

```
Once your typedef is generally\-available and you are happy with the baseline UX:

1. Raise a pull request (PR) from your branch (`JIRA-TASK-ID`) to `develop` on [atlanhq/atlan\-frontend](https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-frontend) .
2. Request someone review the PR by posting a simple message with a link to the PR on [\#team\-frontend](https://atlanhq.slack.com/archives/C02DDQ79H6Z) .

Once approved and merged to `develop`, the front\-end will automatically propagate through to `main` over the course of 3 business days. (Once in `main` it will be generally\-available on all tenants.)
