Getting Started and Onboarding
==============================

Everything you need to know when starting with Atlan \- from trials and demos to deployment options and implementation requirements.

### Is there a trial version of Atlan that I can use to learn more on my own?[â](#is-there-a-trial-version-of-atlan-that-i-can-use-to-learn-more-on-my-own "Direct link to Is there a trial version of Atlan that I can use to learn more on my own?")

You can sign up for the [product tour](https://atlan.com/demo/?ref=/) with your business email to learn more about Atlan.

### Do you have customers in my industry?[â](#do-you-have-customers-in-my-industry "Direct link to Do you have customers in my industry?")

Atlan has customers across a wide variety of industries, including highly regulated industries like financial services and healthcare. Feel free to review the [customers page](https://atlan.com/customers/), or [reach out](https://atlan.com/forms/talk-to-sales/) to discuss your use case in more detail.

### What are the implementation and maintenance requirements?[â](#what-are-the-implementation-and-maintenance-requirements "Direct link to What are the implementation and maintenance requirements?")

There are no additional costs incurred during implementation. To support the user/process transformation within your organization, Atlan provides an optional Accelerator Package with cultural enablement services.

In terms of individuals and responsibilities required to run and maintain Atlan, both may vary depending on the following two factors:

* Size of your organization (10, 100, 1000 users).
* Organizational structure (data mesh vs. data stewardship model).

Typically, the application is owned by at least 1 data engineer persona and 1 persona responsible for data governance, data enablement, and information architecture. You'd only be in charge of managing data source integrations because Atlan is deployed as software as a service (SaaS).

### Where's Atlan deployed?[â](#wheres-atlan-deployed "Direct link to Where's Atlan deployed?")

Atlan is a cloud\-first solution. [Single\-tenant SaaS](/platform/references/how-are-resources-isolated) is the recommended deployment model.

Atlan currently supports hosting tenants on the following cloud platforms:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

For more information, see [Atlan architecture](/platform/references/atlan-architecture).

### What cloud providers do you support?[â](#what-cloud-providers-do-you-support "Direct link to What cloud providers do you support?")

Atlan currently supports hosting tenants on the following cloud platforms:

* [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/platform/references/atlan-architecture#amazon-web-services-aws)
* [Microsoft Azure](/platform/references/atlan-architecture#microsoft-azure)
* [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/platform/references/atlan-architecture#google-cloud-platform-gcp)

### What's the maintenance window for managing updates?[â](#whats-the-maintenance-window-for-managing-updates "Direct link to What's the maintenance window for managing updates?")

In addition to [regular feature rollouts](/get-started/faqs/how-are-product-updates-deployed), Atlan performs monthly tenant infrastructure upgrades to enhance the performance, stability, and security of the tenant. Unless explicitly outlined otherwise in your organization's contract, these upgrades are performed for a period of 2\-4 hours during a predetermined low usage window, usually over the weekend in your timezone.

For any upgrades requiring downtime, Atlan provides notice to organizations at least 1 week in advance. For any further questions about the maintenance window, please [reach out to Atlan support](/support/submit-request).
