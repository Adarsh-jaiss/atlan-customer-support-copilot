Administrators
==============

User management[â](#user-management "Direct link to User management")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

User management is a critical part of data governance. Atlan's [user management capabilities](https://ask.atlan.com/hc/en-us/sections/6319523399441-Users-and-Groups) should be a mainstay of how you organize and control access for people in your organization.

### Add and manage users from the admin center[â](#add-and-manage-users-from-the-admin-center "Direct link to Add and manage users from the admin center")

[https://demo.arcade.software/AETVYXpU1SxmbPLmmeV8?embed&embed_mobile=tab&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true](https://demo.arcade.software/AETVYXpU1SxmbPLmmeV8?embed&embed_mobile=tab&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true)

It's super simple to [invite](/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/how-tos/invite-new-users) and [remove](/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/how-tos/manage-users) users from Atlan from the *Admin center*. You can also [manage existing users](/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/how-tos/manage-users) by adding them to groups, changing their roles, or set up [SSO](/product/integrations/identity-management/sso), [SCIM](/product/integrations/identity-management/scim/how-tos/configure-scim-provisioning), and [SMTP](/product/integrations/communication/smtp-and-announcements/how-tos/configure-smtp) configurations.

### Manage access control from the governance center[â](#manage-access-control-from-the-governance-center "Direct link to Manage access control from the governance center")

[https://demo.arcade.software/g4io3TWC1XpKxuj4Ddrq?embed&embed_mobile=tab&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true](https://demo.arcade.software/g4io3TWC1XpKxuj4Ddrq?embed&embed_mobile=tab&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true)

The *Governance center* is where you can build access control mechanisms to [manage user access](/product/capabilities/governance/custom-metadata/how-tos/control-access-metadata-data).

*[Personas](/product/capabilities/governance/access-control/concepts/what-are-personas)* allow you to group users into teams, such as `Financial Analysts` or `Cloud Engineers`, and set policies based on the access those personas should have.

*[Purposes](/product/capabilities/governance/access-control/concepts/what-are-purposes)* are where you can build policies based on the actions or access that a user might need. For example, you can use Atlan's policy\-based access controls to manage access to PII and other sensitive data. This is a best practice for data governance.

Once you set these policies, Atlan will enforce them throughout your users' experience. This means that users who don't have access to a particular type of data will not be able to see it.

*[Governance workflows](/product/capabilities/governance/stewardship/how-tos/automate-data-governance)* help you set up robust controls on data access management, metadata enrichment, new entity creation, and more, with out\-of\-the\-box workflow templates and automated execution.

Asset profile[â](#asset-profile "Direct link to Asset profile")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[https://demo.arcade.software/I7oUUwHo7NGB9CN2NHm4?embed](https://demo.arcade.software/I7oUUwHo7NGB9CN2NHm4?embed)

The [asset profile](/product/capabilities/discovery/concepts/what-are-asset-profiles) in Atlan gives you a quick and clear understanding of what a data asset contains. You can think of the asset profile as the TL;DR about your data.

Glossary[â](#glossary "Direct link to Glossary")
--------------------------------------------------

[https://demo.arcade.software/6n1DX03pe25iT4QHbzfY?embed](https://demo.arcade.software/6n1DX03pe25iT4QHbzfY?embed)

The Atlan [glossary](/product/capabilities/governance/glossary/concepts/what-is-a-glossary) is a rich tool for defining and organizing your data [terminology](/product/capabilities/governance/glossary/concepts/what-is-a-glossary) to improve transparency and share knowledge. No need to ask around for what a column name means. The glossary functions as a source of truth for teams to understand their data assets. Start keeping all your definitions in one searchable place.

The glossary provides key intel on your data assets so you can quickly understand important attributes of your data, such as:

* [Owners](/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/add-owners) of your data, so you know who to ask for clarification.
* [Certificate](/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/add-certificates) status, to easily understand if metadata enrichment is still in progress or the asset is ready to be used.
* [Linked assets](/product/capabilities/governance/glossary/how-tos/link-terms-to-assets) that are relevant to the term, so you can explore other helpful material.

**Did you know?**The glossary helps power [Atlan's powerful search tool](/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/search-and-discover-assets), so tagging and defining assets are critical to helping your team find what they need.

Discovery[â](#discovery "Direct link to Discovery")
-----------------------------------------------------

[https://demo.arcade.software/0HxsYSxjfC5TmDVv3Y5Z?embed](https://demo.arcade.software/0HxsYSxjfC5TmDVv3Y5Z?embed)

We rely on search bars to find things in almost every corner of the internet. Atlan uses a similar search tool to help you explore your data assets. The [discovery tool](/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/search-and-discover-assets) is Atlan's powerful in\-platform search, powered by the terms and descriptions you've added to your data assets.

Here are a few of the things that make Atlan's discovery awesome:

* Every attribute of your data is searchable in Atlan \- saved SQL queries, schemas, links, and more. This lets you search far and wide to find exactly what you need.
* Intelligent keyword recognition sees through your typos to show exactly what you wanted, no matter what you actually typed.
* Search assets from just about any page in Atlan using **Cmd/Ctrl\+K** or by clicking **Search assets across Atlan** at the top of any page.
* Control your search by using facets about your data (such as the verification status or owner) to find what's most important to you.
* Sort by popularity to quickly discover what assets your teammates are using every day.

* [quick\-start](/tags/quick-start)
