Atlan AI
========

â **Available to customers in Enterprise and Business\-Critical platform editions**

You can use Atlan AI to supercharge the documentation of your data assets and gain meaningful insights from your data estate in Atlan.

**Did you know?**Atlan uses [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/cognitive-services/openai-service) to power Atlan AI. Atlan does **not** send any data to the AI service and only uses metadata for supported capabilities. For questions about data security, see [Atlan AI security](/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security).

Enable Atlan AI[â](#enable-atlan-ai "Direct link to Enable Atlan AI")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Who can do this?You will need to be an [admin user](/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/concepts/what-are-user-roles#admin) in Atlan to enable Atlan AI.

Only admin users in Atlan can enable Atlan AI for their organization. Once enabled, each user's existing [permissions](/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/concepts/what-are-user-roles) and [access policies](/product/capabilities/governance/custom-metadata/how-tos/control-access-metadata-data) in Atlan will determine how they can use Atlan AI. For example, a user must have the permission to edit metadata to use Atlan AI for updating asset descriptions.

1. From the left menu of any screen in Atlan, click **Admin**.
2. Under the *Workspace* heading, click **Labs**.
3. On the *Labs* page, under the *Atlan AI* heading:

    * Turn on **Enrich metadata** to enable your users to use Atlan AI for [documenting assets](#use-atlan-ai-to-document-assets), [explaining lineage transformations](/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/how-tos/use-atlan-ai-for-lineage-analysis), and [generating aliases](/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/add-an-alias).
4. (Optional) For *Customize Atlan AI*, click the **Add instructions** button to make Atlan AI suggestions more relevant to your organization. In the *Enhance suggestions* dialog, for *General instructions*, describe your organization and add details about your product, mission, and more, and then click **Save**.

You have now unleashed the power of Atlan AI for your users! ð

If you'd like to disable Atlan AI from your organization's Atlan workspace, follow the steps above to turn it off.

**Did you know?**If [Atlan AI is disabled](#enable-atlan-ai), the feature will no longer be available in your workspace. However, any descriptions previously generated by Atlan AI and added to your assets or saved SQL queries will still be available.
