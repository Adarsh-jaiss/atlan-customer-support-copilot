Who can do this?Before you can create a data domain, you will need your Atlan admin to [enable the products module in your Atlan workspace](/product/capabilities/data-products/concepts/what-are-data-products). Once enabled, first review the [order of operations](/product/capabilities/data-products/concepts/what-are-data-products#order-of-operations). You will need to be a [domain owner or domain admin in Atlan](/product/capabilities/data-products/concepts/what-are-data-products) or have access through [domain policies](/product/capabilities/data-products/how-tos/create-domain-policies) to create and manage data domains. If you do not wish to enable the products module but still want to create domains in Atlan, refer to [How to manage domains](/product/capabilities/governance/domains/how-tos/manage-domains) instead.

Data domains provide a logical way of grouping data products within a specific domain or business entity \- for example, functions like finance and sales, business units for different products and services, regions of operation, and more. Most importantly, data domains help in fostering collaboration and promote shared ownership and domain\-level governance in your organization.

Data domains in Atlan take true meaning from:

* Key stakeholders of a specific domain and their roles
* Data products within that specific domain
