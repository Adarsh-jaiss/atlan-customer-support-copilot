ollowing steps.

Archived assets[â](#archived-assets "Direct link to Archived assets")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Did you know?**Archived assets still exist in Atlan. They are only "soft\-deleted" and do not appear in search results (by default). You can only access archived assets through discovery.

Assets can be archived when:

* You lose permissions to an asset at source.
* The asset name is changed at source.
* An asset is removed at source or moved to a different schema or database.
* Delete your assets either by [deleting a connection](/product/capabilities/discovery/faq#delete-an-asset) or [configuring](/product/capabilities/discovery/faq#delete-an-asset) it in Atlan.

### Search for archived assets[â](#search-for-archived-assets "Direct link to Search for archived assets")

To search for archived assets:

1. From the left menu of any page, click **Assets**.
2. Under *Filters* on the left, expand **Properties**.
3. At the bottom of the list of properties, click **Is Archived** and then **Yes**.
4. Now [use any additional filters](/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/use-the-filters-menu), and the results will include only archived assets.

### View details of an archived asset[â](#view-details-of-an-archived-asset "Direct link to View details of an archived asset")

To view the details of an archived asset:

1. Search for the asset using the steps above. Narrow down your results using the other filters or search details.
2. Click the card for the asset you want to view.
3. Use the right sidebar to view the details of the asset. The icons on the far right of the sidebar allow you to review different aspects of the asset.

Deleted assets[â](#deleted-assets "Direct link to Deleted assets")
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Assets that have been (hard\-)deleted no longer exist in Atlan. So you cannot find them by searching, or even access them through a direct link.
