How many times has someone complained to you that the data is incomplete or has issues? And how many times have you responded that it's still a work in progress or they're using the wrong data!

Wouldn't it be really convenient if the data could answer these questions?

Certificates in Atlan can help! The certification tags help users quickly identify whether a data asset is ready to use, a work in progress, or has some issues.

You can add the following four certification tags to any data asset:

* **Verified** for ready to be used.
* **Draft** for work in progress.
* **Deprecated** if the asset no longer exists.
* **No certificate** if not required or needs documentation down the line.

**Did you know?**Certificates can be used to quickly filter data assets on the *Assets* page. This helps build trust in your data assets among users.

Add certificates to your assets[â](#add-certificates-to-your-assets "Direct link to Add certificates to your assets")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To add or update the certificate for your data assets, follow these steps:

1. On the Atlan homepage, click **Assets** in the left menu.
2. Click on the **asset** to open its asset profile.
3. In the right menu, click **\+** under *Certificate* and choose the relevant certification option.
4. Write a message to add more context.Â

Now your data can proudly display its status for all to see! ð

Once you have selected a certification tag for your data asset, you will get a popup that your certificate has been saved.
