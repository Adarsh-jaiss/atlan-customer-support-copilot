What is the default permission for a glossary?
==============================================

By default, users can search and discover [glossaries](/product/capabilities/governance/glossary/concepts/what-is-a-glossary) in Atlan, irrespective of their user role. The rationale being that glossaries are meant to be accessible to all users who want to understand business context. You can define a [glossary policy](/product/capabilities/governance/custom-metadata/how-tos/control-access-metadata-data#glossary-policies) to control what users can do with glossary metadata and [create a persona](/product/capabilities/governance/access-control/how-tos/create-a-persona) to curate edit access.

In addition, admins can [turn off the default behavior](/product/administration/labs/how-tos/restrict-glossary-visibility), so that your member and guest users will only have access to the glossaries curated through glossary policies in their personas.
