What are processes?
===================

Processes represent the movement and transformation of assets in Atlan. On the [lineage graph](/product/capabilities/lineage/how-tos/view-lineage), processes are the circular buttons with icons denoting the sources. Processes help you understand the transformations taking place from one asset to another and whether to take action.

By default, process assets are only visible on the lineage graph and sidebar. If [enabled](/product/administration/labs/how-tos/enable-discovery-of-process-assets) by an admin user, you will be able to [search](/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/search-and-discover-assets), [filter](/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/use-the-filters-menu), and discover process assets and track metrics in the [reporting center](/product/capabilities/reporting/references/how-to-report-on-assets).
