What are Power BI processes on the lineage graph?
=================================================

[Processes](/product/capabilities/lineage/concepts/what-are-processes) in general represent the movement and transformation of assets in Atlan. By default, [process assets are hidden](/product/administration/labs/how-tos/enable-discovery-of-process-assets) on the assets page and reporting center.

Note that process entities may not have a counterpart entity in Microsoft Power BI. Consider these to be nodes that you can enrich with metadata to describe the process or relationship between two Microsoft Power BI assets.

These can be especially useful for SQL\-first sources like Snowflake, in which case the process entities show the transformation SQL query that was parsed to generate lineage. This allows users to easily discover source code or scripts.
