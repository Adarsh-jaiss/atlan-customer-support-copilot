What is included in the Slack integration?
==========================================

With two of your most important workspaces connected, you can save time and improve the way you share data assets with your team.

Once you [integrate Slack with Atlan](/product/integrations/collaboration/slack/how-tos/integrate-slack) you can do all of the following â all without leaving Atlan!

* Share data assets on Slack
* Link important Slack threads to Atlan assets
* Start Slack conversations
* Set up Slack notifications for [announcements](/product/integrations/communication/smtp-and-announcements/how-tos/create-announcements), [governance workflows](/product/capabilities/governance/stewardship/how-tos/manage-governance-workflows), [glossary updates](#enable-alerts-for-glossary-updates-in-atlan), [starred assets](/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/star-assets), and [playbook runs](/product/capabilities/playbooks/how-tos/manage-playbooks)

When users share assets on Slack (like assets, glossaries and saved queries) Atlan provides an embedded preview and context for the asset directly in Slack.

infoðª **Did you know?** To use all of the features outlined, each user needs to [connect their individual Slack account](/product/integrations/collaboration/slack/how-tos/link-your-slack-account) to their Atlan profile.
