When does Atlan become a personal data processor or subprocessor?
=================================================================

Atlan personnel do not have access to any customer instance unless specifically provided by the customer. Accordingly, in the event that a customer instance contains personal data and Atlan personnel are provided access to that instance, Atlan may act as a personal data processor. In addition, depending on whether the customer is a data controller or processor, Atlan may act as a data processor or subprocessor, respectively.

For this purpose, where Atlan customers intend to crawl any personal data into the platform, Atlan enters into a data protection agreement with its customers, and as applicable: a [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC)](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) under EU GDPR, an [International data transfer agreement (IDTA)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/) under UK GDPR, or a [HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/sample-business-associate-agreement-provisions/index.html) when dealing with personal health information governed by HIPAA regulations.
