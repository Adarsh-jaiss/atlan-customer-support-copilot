What is included in the Jira integration?
=========================================

With two of your most important workspaces connected, you can save time and improve the way you track issues for your data.

Once you integrate Jira with Atlan you can do all of the following \- all without leaving Atlan!

* Create new Jira issues on assets
* Link existing Jira issues to assets
* See the complete history of Jira issues for each asset

**Did you know?**To use all of the features outlined, each user needs to [connect their individual Jira account](/product/integrations/project-management/jira/how-tos/link-your-jira-account) to their Atlan profile.

Create new Jira issues on assets[â](#create-new-jira-issues-on-assets "Direct link to Create new Jira issues on assets")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dangerYou will first need to [add a labels field](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/add-fields-to-a-screen/) to your *Create issue* form in Jira to be able to create Jira issues on your assets in Atlan.

To create issues in Jira, without leaving Atlan:

1. From any asset, on the right of the screen, click the **Jira** sidebar icon.
2. Click theÂ**Add Issue** button, and then **Create Issue**.
3. From the *Creating issue* dialog:
    1. (Optional) ForÂ*Project* select the project for the issue. (By default, the project [configured during integration](/product/integrations/project-management/jira/how-tos/integrate-jira-cloud) will be selected.)
    2. (Optional) ForÂ*Issue type* select the type of issue being created in Jira.
    3. ForÂ*Title* enter a brief summary of the issue.
    4. ForÂ*Description* enter the detailed explanation of the issue.
4. Click theÂ**Create** button to submit your issue to Jira.

Your issue is now on Jira and linked to the asset for future reference! ð

2. Click theÂ**Add Issue** button, and then **Link Issue**.
3. From theÂ*Link Issues* dialog:
